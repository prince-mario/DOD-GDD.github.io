				<h2>Dumbell & Co</h2>
				<p>
					This is where the game will start off. There won't be 
					that much gameplay here, mainly just story-building, where 
					the manager of the gym tells Chad that he cannot afford the
					membership because he is broke.  Chad offers to clear the dungeon 
					underneath in order to work out at his gym.

				<h2>Goblin Gym</h2>
				<p>
					This is the first gym in the dungeon where goblins go to get buff. 
					It includes the tutorial area and teaches the player the core gameplay loop of the game.
					There are also gym rats on the prowl

				<h2>Elf Gym</h2>
				<p>
					The second gym is for the elves and is the first expansive area that allows exploration.
					The gym rats are also here but they avoid the elves and steal equipment to use for themselves.

				<h2>Wizard Gym</h2>
				<p>
					Down in the wizard gym we start to see how focus on certain muscle groups grants
					special moves that are only possible when priortizing different muscle groups. This
					is also when the player gets their first glimpse of the unnatural.
