					This is where the game will start off. There won't be 
					that much gameplay here, mainly just story-building, where 
					the manager of the gym tells Chad that he cannot afford the
					membership because he is broke.  Chad offers to clear the dungeon 
					underneath in order to work out at his gym.

				<h2>Goblin Gym</h2>
