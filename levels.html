				<h2>Dumbell & Co.</h2>
				<p>
					This is where the game will start off. There won't be
					that much gameplay here, mainly just story-building, where
					the manager of the gym tells Chad that he cannot afford the
					membership because he is broke. Chad offers to clear the dungeon
					underneath in order to work out at his gym.

				<h2>Goblin Gym</h2>
				<p>
					This is the first gym in the dungeon where goblins go to get buff.

					There are also gym rats on the prowl

				<h2>Wizard Gym</h2>
				<p>
					Down in the wizard gym we start to see how focus on certain muscle groups grants
					special moves that are only possible when priortizing different muscle groups. This

				<h2>Body Dungeon</h2>
				<p>
					In this area the individual muscle groups have become independant and are roaming on their own.
					The place contains some equipment but is closer to an animal's den.

				<h2>Muscle God Lair</h2>
				<p>
					This are is twisted and foul. It contains eldritch horrors that feed off
					of protein and everything down here is mutated to the extreme form of 
					muscle that it has. The final boss is the muscle god who has claimed all the
					gym passes.
