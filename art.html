				<h2>Art Direction</h2>

				<h2>Art Style</h2>
				<p>
					THe art style is pixel art with the cartoon style of Castle Crashers. The gameplay is isometric so
					characters and enviroments will have a perspective similar to Cult of the lamb. Everything has to
					point
					back to the theme, so even the doors to rooms will be riped with bulging eyes form all
					the steroids. enemies are working out while ideling. If it does not relate to eather fantasy dungon
					crawl or working out get it out of here.
				</p>
				<h2>Main Concepts</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Riped, make everythign muscle bound
					</li>
					<li>
						Weights, hav wizards lifting dumbells with magic and three goblins in a row benchpressing
						together.
					</li>
					<li>
						Fantasy, this is a world where magic and the Gym come together dont forget to add a little magic
					</li>

				</ul>
				<br>
				<h3>Main Character</h3>
				<p>
					Our hero starts as a skinny boy with big dreams, as we go we can show his progress by adding more
					muscles.
					He has his shirt off and is ready to work out
					keep in mind that he is there not just to fight but to work out, so have him throw weights and when
					he uppercuts his arm flexes.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Enemies</h3>
				<p>
					Enemis are where the humor and theme of the game really shine,
					<strong>enemies are jokes</strong>, try to keep things funny. Gym-rats(rats that walk on two legs
					and are ripped) and wizards who lift with magic and still get buff, enemies that work out neck so
					much thats all that is left. every enemy should put a smile on somones face.
					keep in mind the <strong>Main Concepts</strong>
